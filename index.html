     <h1>dagdusheth </h1>
    <p><b>Dagadusheth Halwai</b> was a successful sweet seller (Halwai) and a rich businessman in the city of Pune in the late 1800s. His original halwai shop still exists under the name <ins>"Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets"</ins> near Datta Mandir in Pune. In the late 1800s, he and his wife Laxmibai lost their only son in a plague epidemic. The grieving couple followed the advice of a sage to build a <u>Ganesh temple </u> Pune in his memory.[5] Later, Dagdusheth adopted, his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years old at the time of his death <mark>Govindsheth </mark> the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk. A generous man, he established an additional Ganesh idol in a wrestling gym called Jagoba Dada Talim. This talim was owned by Dagdusheth as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (square) in Pune is named <mark><i>Govind Halwai Chowk</i></mark>, after him.</p>
